# Object Detection using Faster-RCNN in Tensorflow
This notebook demonstrates an example on how to use object detection models available in Tensorflow Hub. In the following sections, we can:
* Explore and download an available model on the Tensorflow Hub
* Preprocess an image for inference
* Run inference on the models and visualize the output


As a result, we can run our detector and print the number of objects found followed by three lists:
* The detection scores of each object found (i.e. how confident the model is)
* The classes of each object found
* The bounding boxes of each object
